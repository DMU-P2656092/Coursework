        <p>The Day the Earth Stood Still is a 2008 American science fiction drama film and a loose adaptation of the 1951 film
          of the same name. The screenplay by David Scarpa is based on the 1940 science fiction short story "Farewell to the
          Master" by Harry Bates and the 1951 screenplay adaptation by Edmund H. North.</p>
        <p>Directed by Scott Derrickson and starring Keanu Reeves as Klaatu, this version replaces the Cold War theme of nuclear
          warfare with the contemporary issue of humankind's environmental damage to the planet. It follows Klaatu, an alien
          sent to try to change human behavior or eradicate humans from Earth. (<i>The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)</i>, 2008).</p>
