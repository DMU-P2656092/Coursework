      <p class="CastTxt1-1"><strong>Keanu Reeves</strong> is an Lebanese actor who was 31 years-old at the time of making this film.
        His previous roles included '<strong>The Matrix</strong>', '<strong>Speed</strong>', and '<strong>The Watcher</strong>'.
        <strong>Reeves</strong> played a key role in '<strong>The Day The Earth Stood Still</strong>' as the extraterrestrial
        'Klaatu' who disguises himself as a human to investigate the current behaviour of the human race, and to see whether they are a
        plague to the planet and whether they should be exterminated.</p>
      <br> <!-- Page Break gives the two bodies of text some room to space them out and avoids them clashing together when other elemts are moved using css. -->
      <p class="CastTxt1-2">In the beginning, <strong>Reeves</strong> is shown to be very introverted and finds the way humans act and
        speak to be very foreign as he carries a stern attitude towards the humans and shows no remorse towards them and what his species
        are planning. Throughout the film, we see how Reeves' charcater begins to sympathise with humanity, and whilst they have
        their faults, they do not deserve to be exterminated. This is with the help of a young woman (<strong>Jennifer Connelly</strong>) and her child
        (<strong>Jayden Smith</strong>).</p>

      <p class="CastTxt2-1"><strong>Jennifer Connelly</strong> is an Americn actress, who prior to this movie, worked on other titles
        such as, '<strong>Blood Diamond</strong>', '<strong>Elf</strong>', and '<strong>Hulk</strong>'. Her charcter, 'Helen Benson'
        is the mother of 'Jacob Benson' (<strong>Jaden Smith</strong>). She encounters 'Klaatu' (<strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>) rather clearly
        into the film and attempts to convince him to not destroy the human race in order to save the planet.</p>
      <br> <!-- Page Break gives the two bodies of text some room to space them out and avoids them clashing together when other elemts are moved using css. -->
      <p class="CastTxt2-2"> Throughout the film we see the progression that 'Benson' makes in her attempt to convince 'Klaatu' to spare
        the human race. Originally, she takes the path of desperation and begging, however, as time passes, she begins to understand where 'Klaatu'
        sees the faults in the humans. Once she realises this, 'Benson' tries to methodically show the innocence and purity of the human race
        as she now knows that demanding for the species survail will not help at all.</p>

      <p class="CastTxt3-1"><strong>Jaden Smith</strong> was only a child at the time of filming, being only 10 years old. He potrayed the
        part of 'Jacob Benson', the child of 'Helen Benson' (<strong>Jennifer Connelly</strong>). Whilst being prodominantly a background
        character, <strong>Smith</strong> plays a key role in the persuasion of the extraterrestrial 'Klaatu'
        (<strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>) to not exterminate the human race.</p>
        <br> <!-- Page Break gives the two bodies of text some room to space them out and avoids them clashing together when other elemts are moved using css. -->
      <p class="CastTxt3-2">Not much attention is brought to 'Jacob' through the majority of the film, it is not until towards the end
        where the bond between 'Helen' (<strong>Connelly</strong>) and 'Klaatu' (<strong>Reeves</strong>) is formed, that <strong>Smith's</strong>
        acting really comes to light. When 'Jacob' is hit by the weapon used by the aliens, his desperate grasp onto life is what shows the innocence
        of the human race, and subsequently is the turning point of the plot.</p>
